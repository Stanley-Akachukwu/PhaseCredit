# PhaseCredit is a sample internal banking application used to manage credit deposit in phases. 
The customer servers use the application to register and manage customers who are interested in making phase credit deposit which in a long run expected to yield profit.
This project is built using mediat R framework. Other technologies are entity framework, SQL database,  asp.net blazor IdentityServer  etc. 
The project is still ongoing and I hope to cover all the intending technologies required to build the latest enterprise application.
